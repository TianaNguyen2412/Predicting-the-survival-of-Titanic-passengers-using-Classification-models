# Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic
<p>The project aims to employ different classification models in Machine Learning to predict whether a passenger survived or not the Titanic shipwreck given a dataset. 
<p>The jupyter notebook includes:
<ul>
<li>Data exploration
<li>Data visualization
<li>Modeling <i>(Building models, Hyperparameter tuning, Model evaluation)</i>
<li>Making predictions 
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Datasets:</h3>
Datasets are drawn from Kaggle. There are two datasets for this project, one for trainning, and the other for testing.<br>
Datasets contains 11 columns (excluded identifier column) with 10 predictor variables and one target variable (Survived). <br>
Predictor variables mainly fall into two main categories: Passenger and ticket information.

<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
<ul>
<li>numpy
<li>pandas
<li>matplotlib
<li>seaborn
<li>sklearn
</ul>
